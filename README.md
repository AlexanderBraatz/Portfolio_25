## Why does this project exist?

I began this project out of a need to diplay my work fo r potnetial clients and employers. it soon grew into an exploration into serverless architecture simply becasue i was trying to make the magic link supaer base auth feature work. after testing the testimonial feature with a few people i had identefied the password creation step as a key point of friction and i wanted to address it by swithcing to a magic link based aut system. This repo also includes the use of shadCn Ui componets which i alos enyed working with while they were a time save when taking in to acount the accesability and cross broswer compatability they insure, but the fine tuning of styles to match the rest of my app which wasnt shadCn took a long time. 

The project was driven by three primary goals:

- **Developing a Modern, User-Friendly Showcase of my work ** <br/>The aim was to create an engaging online platform to exhibit my projects.
- **Display my Peers reviews while also demonstrating my full stack skills** <br/>A key requirement was to build out the features of a CRUD app for my Testimonals so i could mention both onmy CV

the gratest chalange of the project was that i did not know what i didnot know when i set out to enebale magic link for the user auth and how many other steps ding this to a production grade would involve 

- seting up a custom SMPT server and verefieng my onw DNS records for example ose one thing
- setting up supaabse ege functions to send the emails was another

i ultematly scetched out the flow of data in this document. this DOcument is arguably to complex and information rich to be usfull to anyone who isnt in volved with the tech stack but it helped me in understanding why what i had built was working.
