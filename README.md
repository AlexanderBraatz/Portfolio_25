# My Modern Portfolio

<a href="https://alexanderbraatz.com" target="_blank">alexanderbraatz.com</a> is built using Next.js and supabase. It serves as my digital front page, showcasing my projects and reviews from my colleagues and clients.

## Why does this project exist?

I began this project out of a need to display my work for potential clients and employers. It soon grew into an exploration of serverless architecture simply because I was trying to make the magic link Supabase auth feature work. After testing the testimonial feature with a few people, I identified the password creation step as a key point of friction, and I wanted to address it by switching to a magic linkâ€“based auth system.

This repo also includes the use of shadcn/ui components, which I also enjoyed working with. While they were a time-saver when taking into account accessibility and cross-browser compatibility, the fine-tuning of styles to match the rest of my app (which wasbuilt without using shadcn) took a long time.

The project was driven by three primary goals:

- **Developing a Modern, User-Friendly Showcase of my work** <br/>The aim was to create an engaging online platform to exhibit my projects.
- **Displaying my endorsments fom Peers and creating a seamless review submission process** <br/>A key requirement was to build out the features of a CRUD app for my testimonials

The greatest challenge of the project was that I didnâ€™t know what I didnâ€™t know when I set out to enable magic links for user authentication, or how many other steps making this production-grade would involve.

1.  Setting up a custom SMTP server and verifying my own DNS records, for example, was one task.
2.  Setting up Supabase edge functions to send the emails was another.

I ultimately sketched out the flow of data in this document. This document is arguably too complex and information-rich to be useful to anyone who isnâ€™t involved with the tech stack, but it helped me understand why what I had built was working.
